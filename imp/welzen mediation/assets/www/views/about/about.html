    <p class="paragraph">â€¦got together, had a child and named him Welzen. We started this company because we believe we can become a better society. We believe we can help this cause by taking care of our mind. Mindfulness teaches a lot of things but our main take away is that it empowers us to practice acceptance in 2 specific ways: first, by accepting ourselves as wonderful and dark as we are, and secondly, by fully experiencing each moment with all that it has to offer.</p>
